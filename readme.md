## Introduction
Welcome to the Web3 Cohort Program repository! This program is designed to provide hands-on experience with Web3 technologies. Throughout the course, participants work on various assignments and projects that cover key concepts and skills required for blockchain development and decentralized applications.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies and tools are used in this repository:

### Blockchain Platforms
- **Ethereum**: A decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and DApps to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, or interference.
- **Binance Smart Chain**: A blockchain that runs in parallel to the Binance Chain, enabling smart contracts and DApps with faster transaction times and lower fees.
- **Polygon (Matic)**: A framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.

### Smart Contract Languages
- **Solidity**: A statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Vyper**: A Pythonic programming language for smart contracts that aims for simplicity, security, and auditability.

### Development Tools
- **Truffle**: A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier.
- **Hardhat**: A flexible development environment for Ethereum software that helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to building smart contracts and DApps.
- **Ganache**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development that you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests.

### Frontend Frameworks and Libraries
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **Web3.js**: A collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.

### Backend and Databases
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.

### Additional Tools
- **IPFS**: A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
- **MetaMask**: A crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps.

## Assignments
1. **Introduction to Blockchain**: Basic concepts and history of blockchain technology.
2. **Ethereum and Smart Contracts**: Introduction to Ethereum and hands-on development of smart contracts using Solidity.
3. **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: Building a basic DApp using React and Web3.js.
4. **Advanced Smart Contracts**: Developing complex smart contracts and understanding security considerations.
5. **Interacting with DeFi Protocols**: Understanding and interacting with decentralized finance protocols.
